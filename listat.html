            <p><strong>Tiramisu</strong>is a coffee-flavored dessert that features layers of homemade whipped cream, an egg yolk-enriched mascarpone filling, and coffee-soaked ladyfingers.  </p>

        <p>Tiramisu usually contains alcohol. Marsala wine is the traditional choice, but this recipe calls for a mixture of strong coffee and rum. If you prefer not to use alcohol, just leave it out. It will still be delicious with just the coffee alone (just make sure the coffee is extra strong).</p>

        
        <ul>
            <li>1¼ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>¼ cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            </ul>
       
        <p>"This is my absolute favorite, tried-and-true recipe for tiramisu," according to Allie Kate Paterson. "It is better-than-restaurant quality and so easy to make! The hardest part about making it is keeping your hands off of it while it sets in the fridge. The only tweak I make to this recipe is using Kahlua instead of plain rum."</p>

<h3>Common Tiramisu Question - Answered</h3>

<dl>
    <dt><strong> whites or whipped cream?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Most tiramisu recipes use whipped egg whites OR whipped cream in the mascarpone cream layers. Egg whites contribute a more airy texture, while whipped cream makes the filling a bit more rich. This recipe actually uses both, so you’re getting both delightful textures</dd>
<br>
    <dt><b> kind of rum do I use in tiramisu?</b></dt>
    <dd> Dark rum is best, but you can use brandy or your favorite coffee liqueur.</dd>
<br>
    <dt><b>>Are the eggs cooked?</b> </dt>
    <dd>Tiramisu is a no-bake dessert. The egg yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop, but the egg whites are raw. Purchase pasteurized eggs because they are safe to consume raw</dd>
<br>
<dt><b>What size pan to use?</b></dt>
<dd>This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full. Make sure your pan is large enough. I recommend a 9×13 inch dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity. This 4 quart dish is wonderful too.</dd>
